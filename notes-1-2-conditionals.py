# Implement flowchart from the notes
x = input("Enter x: ")
y = input("Enter y: ")
# Create two variables

# If X is greater than  Y, print that
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
# if X is less than y, print that
elif y > x:
    print("x is less than y")
#If x is equal, print that
else: 
    print("x and y are equal")
